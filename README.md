    <b> The Ashire Operating System </b>
</p>


<p align="center">
    A modern and beginner friendly linux-based operating system with it's own Desktop Environment.
</p>

### Features:

- User-friendly installation and setup
- Custom QT Quick-based Desktop environment
- Minimalist design with a focus on speed and efficiency

### Dependencies:

```
sudo apt install wmctrl openbox picom alacritty g++ libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev cmake make
```

You will also need to install QT Quick.

### Licensing, Copyrights, Patents, and Trademarks etc...

This operating system is released under The Unlicense, aiming to be as unrestrictive as possible by releasing all source code into the public domain. I oppose copyrights, patents, and trademarks, believing that true freedom and innovation stem from removing such restrictions. This perspective aligns with Hoppean principles, which emphasize natural property rights and voluntary exchange while criticizing state-granted monopolies and privileges.
